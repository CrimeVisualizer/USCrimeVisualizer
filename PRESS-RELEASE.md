There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Crime Visualization Project [Replace Name]

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  CVP offers curious citizens an interactive, engaging view into the crime patterns across the United States. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  CVP is a highly interactive web browser experience that immerses viewers in the vastness of crime data. With crime patterns
  emerging as a systemic social issue in the United States, social concientious citizens desire new ways to understand 
  the current state of crime in their city. CVP provides an easily understood visual interface to engage with your local community. 
  The interface allows the user to traverse time across years, days, types of crime, location, and district demographics. CVP is a 
  web based experience. 

  Visualization experience:
  - Points stream in at the beginning of the page load 

  Data Visualization Features:

  - Type in address to search bar. Visualize the crime within X mile radius of the inputed address.
  - Filter by:
    - One single 24 hour day
      - Show holidays and peak crime dates
      - Show individual points
    - 10 years, animation incremented by year
      - Show glowing views/heat maps (average the data) - research the best way to visualize this
        - Show the demographic shifts across the time, comparing the 
    - Demographics 
    - Type of Crime
  - Click on district to see crime summary for that period of time
  - Slow down animation, hover over points to see specific crimes
  - Click on points, districts to bring up local news storys, wikipedia info, etc. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Crime is cities is difficult for a citizen to understand on an aggregate level. Beyond local news' annecdotal stories, social 
  issues such at crime are notoriously difficult to convey. Further, it is difficult to deliver this information in an
  engaging medium. Citizens crave this information, but generally lack reputable, accurate sources. The city of San Francisco
  has a database of millions of lines of crime logs. This data tells a story, but is impossible to understand unless
  the data is transformed. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  CVP displays data in an easily digestible, customizable format. Users can play with the data, in part internalizing the 
  information. Users can speed and slow the transition of crime across a day across the city of San Francisco. They
  zoom into an area of San Francisco to inspect the crime in an area of interest, bringing the story to life for 
  their specific conditions. Interactive data is especially powerful for crime patterns as citizens can connect
  with the portions of city they have a specific interest in. And, perhaps, they can understand the conditions 
  outside of their community. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  CVP brings millions of crime logs off the page and captures the imagination, interest, and perhaps action of 
  the citizens of San Francisco. 

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "As a San Francisco native of 15 years, I have seen the city evolve before my eyes. As the city continues to 
  evolve, understanding how the crime throughout the city changes further connects me to my city. "
